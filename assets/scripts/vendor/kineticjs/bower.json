  "readme": "#Building the KineticJS Framework \nTo build the framework, you need to have node installed. After that, run `npm install` in the main directory to install the node module dependencies.\n\nTo build a development version of the framework, run `grunt dev`. To run a full build, which also produces the minified version and the individually minified modules for the custom build, run `grunt full`.  You can also run `grunt beta` to generate a beta version.   \n\nIf you add a file in the src directory, be sure to add the filename to the sourceFiles array variable in Gruntfile.js.\n\n#Testing\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ericdrowell/KineticJS.png)](https://travis-ci.org/ericdrowell/KineticJS)\n\nKineticJS uses Mocha for testing.  If you haven't already, be sure to install the npm packages by running `npm install` in the project directory.  Before testing you have to build KineticJS by running `grunt dev`.The KineticJS tests must be run on a web server, so you also need to run `node server.js` in the project directory to start the node server.  Once the server is running, open http://localhost:8080/test/runner.html to run the tests in your favorite browser.  To run the tests in PhantomJS, run `mocha-phantomjs test/runner.html` in the console.\n\nKineticJS is covered with hundreds of tests and well over a thousand assertions.  KineticJS uses TDD (test driven development) which means that every new feature or bug fix is accompanied with at least one new test. \n\n#Pull Requests\nI'd be happy to review any pull requests that may better the KineticJS project, in particular if you have a bug fix, enhancement, or a new shape (see `src/shapes` for examples).  Before doing so, please first make sure that all of the tests pass.\n",
